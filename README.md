# My E-Commerce Platform

Welcome to the **My E-Commerce Platform** repository! This is a full-stack e-commerce application that provides various services to manage an online store. The repository consists of three main services: **Database Service**, **Notification Service**, and **Order Service**.

## Database Service

The **Database Service** is responsible for initializing and managing the database used by the e-commerce platform. It includes the following files and directories:

- `initdb`: Contains the initialization scripts for setting up the database schema and seeding it with initial data.
- `schema.sql`: SQL script defining the database schema.
- `seed.sql`: SQL script containing the initial data to populate the database.
- `node_modules`: The Node.js dependencies for the database service.
- `Dockerfile`: The Dockerfile used to containerize the database service.
- `docker-compose.yml`: The Docker Compose file defining the services and their configuration.
- `package-lock.json`, `package.json`: Node.js configuration files for the database service.
- `server.js`: The main entry point for the database service.

## Notification Service

The **Notification Service** is responsible for handling notifications and delivering them to users. It includes the following files and directories:

- `controllers`: Contains the controllers for handling notification-related operations.
- `node_modules`: The Node.js dependencies for the notification service.
- `services`: Contains additional services and utilities used by the notification service.
- `Dockerfile`: The Dockerfile used to containerize the notification service.
- `kafka-consumer.js`: The Kafka consumer that listens for notification messages from other services.
- `package-lock.json`, `package.json`: Node.js configuration files for the notification service.
- `server.js`: The main entry point for the notification service.

## Order Service

The **Order Service** is responsible for managing orders and processing order-related operations. It includes the following files and directories:

- `models`: Contains the order model definition.
- `node_modules`: The Node.js dependencies for the order service.
- `routes`: Contains the routes and controllers for handling order-related operations.
- `Dockerfile`: The Dockerfile used to containerize the order service.
- `kafka-producer.js`: The Kafka producer that sends order-related messages to other services.
- `package-lock.json`, `package.json`: Node.js configuration files for the order service.
- `server.js`: The main entry point for the order service.

## Docker Compose

The `docker-compose.yml` file defines the services and their configurations for running the entire e-commerce platform using Docker Compose. It allows you to easily set up and deploy the platform with all its services.

**Note**: This is a basic overview of the project's structure. Additional documentation and detailed instructions can be found in the respective directories and code files.
